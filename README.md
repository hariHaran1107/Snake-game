Snake Game:

The project is created using Intellij IDEA.The code for the snake and board is present under:
snake->src->board.java

The resources used for the project are found under:

In this game, you take command of a snake, directing its movement through the environment. 
The primary goal is to eat as many apples as you can find. 
With each apple consumed, the snake's body elongates, increasing its size and making the game more intense. 
However, be cautious! The snake must navigate carefully to avoid colliding with the boundaries of the game or entangling itself in its own expanding body.
When the snake hits the border or its own body the game ends.

The size of the board is 400 X 400.
The size of each dot of the snake is 10px.
The snake is controlled using the arrow Keys.
Initially, the snake has three dots or joints.
If the snake hits the border or tangles itself, the 'Game Over' message is displayed along with the score.
